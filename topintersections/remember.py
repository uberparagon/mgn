    The idea is that if a function has already been called with the same arguments, you would want to just retrieve the computed value instead of recomputing it.
    
    This decorator allows you to specify a converter that will convert the arguments passed into your function into an appropriate format for use as a dictionary key.  You can also specify a dictionary yourself, so, for example, two functions could share a dictionary.
    
    This also has save and load features, but I think the current implementation of the program doesn't need them.
